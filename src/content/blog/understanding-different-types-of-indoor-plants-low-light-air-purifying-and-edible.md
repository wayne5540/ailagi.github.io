# Understanding Different Types of Indoor Plants: Low-light, Air Purifying, and Edible

When it comes to indoor gardening, there are many different types of plants to choose from. Depending on your needs, you may be interested in low-light plants, air purifying plants, or even edible plants. In this article, we&#39;ll take a look at each type of plant and provide tips for caring for them.

## Low-light Plants

If your indoor space doesn&#39;t receive much natural light, low-light plants are a great option. These plants are able to survive in areas with minimal light exposure, such as hallways, bathrooms, and rooms without windows. Some popular low-light plants include:

- Snake Plant
- ZZ Plant
- Pothos
- Peace Lily

When caring for low-light plants, it&#39;s important not to over-water them. These types of plants are generally able to thrive with minimal watering, so be sure to let the soil dry out between waterings.

## Air Purifying Plants

Air purifying plants are a great option for people who want to improve the air quality in their indoor space. These plants are able to remove toxins and pollutants from the air, making them a great addition to any home or office. Some popular air purifying plants include:

- Spider Plant
- Boston Fern
- Aloe Vera
- Bamboo Palm

When caring for air purifying plants, it&#39;s important to keep them in an area with good air circulation. These plants also benefit from regular dusting to keep their leaves clean.

## Edible Plants

If you&#39;re interested in growing your own food, there are many different types of indoor plants that are edible. These plants can be a fun and rewarding addition to your indoor garden. Some popular edible plants include:

- Basil
- Mint
- Rosemary
- Cherry Tomatoes

When growing edible plants indoors, it&#39;s important to provide them with the right amount of light and water. These plants generally require more watering and sunlight than low-light or air purifying plants, so be sure to do your research before you start planting.

With so many different types of indoor plants to choose from, it can be hard to know where to start. By understanding the different types of plants available, and how to care for them, you can create a beautiful and thriving indoor garden in your home or office space.
