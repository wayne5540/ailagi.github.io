# The Best Deals on Natural Baby Products for Budget-conscious Parents

Parents always want the best for their babies, especially when it comes to products they use every day. If you&#39;re on a tight budget and looking for natural baby products, the search can be overwhelming. But worry not, we&#39;ve got you covered with our top picks and deals on natural baby products.

## Diapers

One of the most essential items for any newborn is diapers. Traditional disposable diapers are full of harmful chemicals such as chlorine, fragrances, and dyes. Luckily, there are more eco-friendly and budget-friendly options out there that are just as effective.

- **Andy Pandy Biodegradable Bamboo Disposable Diapers**: Made with bamboo and have a biodegradable liner, these diapers are gentle on your baby&#39;s skin, and the environment. They also have a wetness indicator and come in cute designs.

- **Earth + Eden Baby Diapers**: Made of naturally derived materials, these diapers are affordable and breathable. They also have a wetness indicator and come with a hypoallergenic liner.

## Skincare

Your baby&#39;s delicate skin needs gentle and natural products. Avoid skincare products with harsh chemicals that can cause irritation and harm such as synthetic fragrances, parabens, and sulfates. Here are some natural options that won&#39;t break the bank.

- **Johnson&#39;s Cotton Touch Newborn Baby Face and Body Lotion**: Made with real cotton and without artificial dyes or parabens, this lotion is not only affordable but gentle enough for everyday use.

- **Burt&#39;s Bees Baby Bee Shampoo and Wash**: This gentle 2-in-1 shampoo and wash is made with natural ingredients such as coconut and sunflower oils. It&#39;s hypoallergenic, tear-free, and safe for daily use.

## Feeding

Breastfeeding, formula, or mixed feeding, whichever you choose, natural and affordable feeding products are available.
