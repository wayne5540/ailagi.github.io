Are you looking for a way to stay fit while working from home? Starting a home workout routine could be the perfect solution for you! But where do you start? In this guide, we&#39;ll provide you with home workouts for different fitness levels including beginners, intermediate, and advanced.

## Beginner Home Workouts

If you&#39;re new to working out, it&#39;s important to start slow and gradually build up your strength and endurance. Here are a few beginner home workouts to get you started:

- **Bodyweight Squats:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward, and keep your hands at your hips. Slowly lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back. Keep your chest up and your back straight. Return to the starting position by pushing through your heels.
- **Push-ups:** Start in a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower your body by bending your elbows until your chest touches the floor. Push back up to the starting position.
- **Jumping jacks:** Stand with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Jump your feet out to the sides while raising your arms overhead. Jump back to the starting position and repeat the movement.

## Intermediate Home Workouts

Once you&#39;ve built up some strength and endurance, you can start incorporating more challenging exercises into your routine. Here are a few intermediate home workouts to try:

- **Burpees:** Start in a standing position, then squat down and place your hands on the floor. Jump your feet out so you&#39;re in a plank position. Do a push-up, then jump your feet back towards your hands. From there, jump up into the air and clap your hands overhead.
- **Mountain Climbers:** Start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Bring your right knee in towards your chest, then quickly switch legs. Keep alternating legs as fast as you can.
- **Lunges:** Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Take a big step forward with your right leg, bending both knees to create 90-degree angles. Push back up to the starting position and repeat with your left leg.

## Advanced Home Workouts

Ready to take your home workouts to the next level? Here are a few advanced exercises to challenge yourself:

- **Single-leg burpees:** Do a regular burpee, but when you jump your feet back towards your hands, lift one leg off the ground. Alternate legs with each repetition.
- **Handstand push-ups:** Start in a handstand position against a wall. Slowly lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, then push back up to the starting position.
- **Plyometric push-ups:** Start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Lower your body by bending your elbows, then explosively push yourself up so your hands leave the ground. Land back in a plank position and repeat the movement.

Remember, it&#39;s important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Start with the beginner workouts and gradually work your way up to the more challenging exercises. And always make sure to warm up properly before starting your workout!
