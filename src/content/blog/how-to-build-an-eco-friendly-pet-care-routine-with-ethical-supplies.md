# How to Build an Eco-Friendly Pet Care Routine with Ethical Supplies 

As pet owners, we want the very best for our furry loved ones. However, we also want to be mindful of our environmental impact and support ethical products. Fortunately, with the rise of ethical pet supplies, it&#39;s easier than ever to build an eco-friendly pet care routine. Here are some tips and recommendations to help you get started. 

## Buy Biodegradable Poop Bags 

One of the biggest contributors to environmental pollution is single-use plastics. As such, purchasing biodegradable poop bags is a simple way to reduce our reliance on plastic and help the environment. Some great options include Earth Rated Poop Bags and Biobag Dog Waste Bags.

## Shop for Eco-Friendly Toys 

Many pet toys are made from synthetic materials that aren&#39;t biodegradable and can take hundreds of years to break down in landfills. To avoid contributing to this waste, look for toys made from natural materials like hemp, wool, and organic cotton. Some options include West Pawâ€™s Hemp and Organic Cotton toys and Jax and Bones Rope Toys made from recycled cotton.

## Opt for Ethical Grooming Supplies 

When it comes to grooming your pet, it&#39;s important to use products that are both ethical and eco-friendly. Look for shampoos and conditioners made from natural ingredients, such as oatmeal or coconut oil. You can also find grooming supplies made from recycled or sustainable materials, such as bamboo brushes or combs. Some great options include Earthbath&#39;s Oatmeal and Aloe shampoo and the Body and Soul Organic Eco-Friendly pet grooming kit.

## Feed Your Pets Ethically 

What your pet eats also has an impact on the environment. Try to buy food that is locally sourced and uses sustainable ingredients. Additionally, you can opt for organic pet food or make your own pet food at home to reduce waste and control the ingredients going into your pet&#39;s diet. Some recommended brands include Wild Earth, The Honest Kitchen, and NomNomNow.

## Invest in a Compostable Pet Bed 

Pet beds are often made from synthetic materials that are not biodegradable. To avoid contributing to this waste, invest in a pet bed made from natural materials like bamboo, organic cotton, or hemp. You can also find pet beds that are fully compostable, such as the Green Pet Shop&#39;s Comfy Perch.

By incorporating these tips and investing in ethical pet supplies, you can create a pet care routine that not only benefits your furry loved ones but also the environment. Let&#39;s all do our part to reduce our environmental impact and build a better future for our pets and ourselves.
