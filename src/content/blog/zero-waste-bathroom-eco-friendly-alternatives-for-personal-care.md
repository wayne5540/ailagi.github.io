# Zero Waste Bathroom: Eco-friendly Alternatives for Personal Care

Are you looking for ways to reduce plastic waste and create a more sustainable personal care routine? A zero waste bathroom is a great place to start! By using eco-friendly alternatives, you can make a positive impact on the environment while keeping your personal care routine intact.

Here are some eco-friendly alternatives for personal care in your zero waste bathroom routine:

## Shampoo and Conditioner Bars

Instead of buying plastic bottles of shampoo and conditioner, consider switching to shampoo and conditioner bars. These bars typically come in paper packaging or no packaging at all, making them a great zero waste option. They&#39;re also convenient for travel because they don&#39;t count as a liquid!

## Bamboo Toothbrushes

Plastic toothbrushes can take hundreds of years to decompose in landfills. Bamboo toothbrushes, on the other hand, are biodegradable and can be composted. They also come in fun colors and designs!

## Reusable Cotton Rounds

If you use cotton rounds for makeup removal or toner application, switch to reusable cotton rounds. These can be washed and used again and again, reducing the amount of single-use cotton rounds that end up in landfills.

## Safety Razors

Instead of using disposable razors, invest in a safety razor. Safety razors can last for years and only require replacement blades, which can be recycled. They also tend to provide a closer shave than disposable razors!

## Menstrual Cups

Tampons and pads also contribute to a significant amount of waste. Menstrual cups are a more sustainable option that can last for years. While the upfront cost may be higher, you&#39;ll save money in the long run by not having to constantly purchase tampons or pads.

By making these simple swaps, you can reduce your plastic waste and create a more eco-friendly zero waste bathroom routine. What are some of your favorite zero waste personal care products? Let us know in the comments below!
