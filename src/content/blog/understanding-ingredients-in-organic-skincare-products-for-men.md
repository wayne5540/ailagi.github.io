### Jojoba Oil

### Witch Hazel

Witch hazel is a natural astringent that can help tighten and tone your skin. It&#39;s often used in organic skincare products for men to reduce the appearance of pores and improve skin texture. Witch hazel also has anti-inflammatory properties, making it a great ingredient for soothing irritated skin.
