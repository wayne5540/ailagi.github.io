## 3. Farmers Markets and Craft Fairs

Farmers markets and craft fairs are an excellent resource for finding local and independent retailers. Check out your local farmers market or craft fair and look for vendors selling zero-waste kitchen gadgets. This is also an excellent opportunity to support small businesses in your community.

## 4. Ask for Recommendations

Finally, don&#39;t be afraid to ask for recommendations. Ask your friends and family if they are aware of any local retailers that specialize in zero-waste kitchen gadgets. You can also ask for recommendations on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
