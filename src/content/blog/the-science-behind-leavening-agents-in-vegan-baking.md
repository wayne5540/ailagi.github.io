# The Science Behind Leavening Agents in Vegan Baking

Baking is a science, but it&#39;s not an exact one. There are a lot of different variables that can impact the final product if not carefully measured and monitored. One of those variables is leavening agents.

For those who are new to the term, leavening agents are what make baked goods rise. They can include things like baking soda, baking powder, and yeast. Each of these leavening agents works in different ways to create the desired outcome.

## Baking Soda

Baking soda is a simple and common leavening agent used in baking. It&#39;s a chemical compound that produces carbon dioxide gas when it comes into contact with acidic ingredients like vinegar or lemon juice. This reaction causes the baked good to rise.

One thing to keep in mind when using baking soda in vegan baking is that many traditional recipes call for eggs. Eggs provide structure and help to trap the gas produced by the baking soda. In vegan baking, you&#39;ll need to find alternative ingredients like flax eggs or chia seeds to replace the eggs and provide the same level of structure.

## Baking Powder

Baking powder is another common leavening agent that&#39;s used in baking. Baking powder is a mixture of baking soda, an acid, and a starch. When combined with moisture, the acid and baking soda in the baking powder react to produce carbon dioxide gas, causing the baked good to rise.

When using baking powder in vegan baking, it&#39;s important to look for aluminum-free options. Some commercial baking powders include aluminum, which has been linked to health concerns.

## Yeast

Yeast is a microorganism that&#39;s used to make bread rise. It works by feeding on the sugars in the dough and producing carbon dioxide gas as a byproduct. The gas gets trapped in the dough, causing it to rise.

When working with yeast in vegan baking, it&#39;s important to note that traditional recipes often call for dairy milk. You can easily substitute plant-based milk options like soy or almond milk to make the recipe vegan-friendly.

## Conclusion

Understanding the science behind leavening agents is important when it comes to vegan baking. Each leavening agent has its own properties and reacts differently depending on the ingredients used. By understanding how they work, you can choose the right leavening agent and achieve the desired results in your vegan baked goods.
