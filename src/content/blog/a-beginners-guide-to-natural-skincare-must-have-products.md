# A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Natural Skincare: Must-Have Products

If you&#39;re new to natural skincare, you might feel overwhelmed by all the options available. From cleansers to serums to moisturizers, it can be tough to know where to start. Here we have listed out some must-have natural skincare products to help you get started.

## Cleanser

The key to any good skincare routine is to start with a good cleanser. Look for a cleanser that is free from harsh chemicals, sulfates, and artificial fragrances. We recommend the **Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser**, which is pH balanced and suitable for all skin types. For a more natural option, try the **Burt&#39;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cleanser**, which is made with 98.9% natural ingredients.

## Toner

Toners can help balance your skin&#39;s pH, remove any remaining dirt, and prepare your skin for the rest of your routine. We recommend the **Thayers Witch Hazel Toner** with rose petal. It&#39;s alcohol-free, gentle, and suitable for all skin types. For a more earth-friendly option, try the **Heritage Store Rosewater Facial Toner**.

## Moisturizer

Moisturizers keep your skin hydrated, plump, and protected. For a natural option, try the **Avalon Organics Intense Defense with Vitamin C Renewal Cream**. It&#39;s packed with antioxidants and helps fight against signs of aging. If you have dry or sensitive skin, try the **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**.

## Sunscreen

Sun protection is key to preventing premature aging and reducing your risk of skin cancer. We recommend the **EltaMD UV Clear Facial Sunscreen**. It&#39;s lightweight, non-greasy, and suitable for all skin types. For a more natural option, try the **ThinkSport Sunscreen SPF 50+**.

## Serum

Serums are packed with powerful ingredients that can address specific concerns, such as dark spots, fine lines, and wrinkles. We recommend the **The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**. It helps control oil production, reduces redness, and improves the appearance of pores. For a more natural option, try **Trilogy Certified Organic Rosehip Oil**. It&#39;s rich in antioxidants and helps improve skin hydration and texture.

With these must-have products, you&#39;re well on your way to a natural, effective skincare routine. Remember to patch test all new products and introduce them one at a time to avoid any adverse reactions.
