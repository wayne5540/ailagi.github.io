Are you trying to eat healthier but struggling to stay within your budget? With smart ingredient choices and affordable appliance options, you can create delicious and nutritious meals without breaking the bank.

## Essential Ingredients
When it comes to healthy cooking on a budget, the key is to focus on nutrient-dense ingredients that are affordable and widely available. Some great options include:

- Brown rice
- Whole grain pasta
- Canned or dried beans
- Frozen vegetables
- Eggs
- Chicken thighs (which are more affordable than chicken breasts)
- Tofu
- Peanut butter
- Oats

## Affordable Appliance Options
Investing in the right kitchen appliances can also help you save money in the long run. Here are some affordable options to consider:

- Slow cooker: A slow cooker is a great investment for anyone trying to eat healthy on a budget. Not only can you cook affordable cuts of meat (like chicken thighs) to perfection, but you can also use it to make hearty soups and stews that will last for days.
- Air fryer: An air fryer is a great option for those who love crispy, fried foods but want to avoid unhealthy oils. You can use an air fryer to make everything from chicken wings to sweet potato fries.
- Blender: A blender is an incredibly versatile appliance that can be used to make everything from smoothies to soups to homemade nut butter. Investing in a high-quality blender is worth the money in the long run.

## Simple, Healthy Recipes
Now that you have your essential ingredients and appliances, it&#39;s time to start cooking! Here are a few simple and affordable recipes to get you started:

- Brown Rice Bowl: Cook brown rice according to package instructions. Top with canned black beans, frozen corn, diced avocado, and a drizzle of hot sauce.
- Slow Cooker Chicken Thighs: Season chicken thighs with salt, pepper, and your favorite spices. Place in a slow cooker with a can of diced tomatoes and a chopped onion. Cook on low for 8 hours.
- Tofu Stir-Fry: Drain and press tofu, then slice into small cubes. In a wok or large skillet, stir-fry chopped vegetables (like broccoli, bell peppers, and onions) until tender. Add tofu and your favorite stir-fry sauce and cook until heated through.

With these ingredients, appliances, and recipes, you can eat healthy and delicious meals without breaking the bank. Happy cooking!
