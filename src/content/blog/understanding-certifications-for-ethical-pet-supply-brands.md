# Understanding Certifications for Ethical Pet Supply Brands

As pet owners, we want our furry friends to be healthy and happy, and part of that comes from the products we buy for them. However, it&#39;s not always easy to know which pet supply brands are ethical and sustainable.

Fortunately, there are certifications available for pet supply brands that ensure ethical practices are followed. Here are some of the most common certifications to look out for:

## Certified B Corporation

A Certified B Corporation meets rigorous social and environmental standards, including treating their workers well and being transparent about their practices. This certification is granted by the nonprofit B Lab, and it&#39;s a surefire way to know that a pet supply brand is truly ethical.

## USDA Organic

The USDA Organic label ensures that no synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs) were used in the creation of a product. This certification doesn&#39;t specifically pertain to animal welfare, but it does ensure that the product is free from harmful chemicals and additives.

## Certified Humane

The Certified Humane label is granted by Humane Farm Animal Care, a nonprofit organization that ensures animals are treated humanely during their lifetime. If you&#39;re buying food or treats for your pets, this label is especially important, as it ensures that the animals used in the product&#39;s creation were treated ethically.

## Global Animal Partnership

The Global Animal Partnership (GAP) sets animal welfare standards across various livestock industries. This certification is especially relevant if you&#39;re buying pet food made from meat products, as it ensures that the animals used in production were raised ethically.

## Fairtrade

The Fairtrade label ensures that farmers and workers involved in the production process are paid fairly and treated ethically. While this certification doesn&#39;t specifically apply to pet supply brands, it&#39;s worth looking out for if a brand sources ingredients from developing countries.

By looking out for these certifications, you can ensure that the pet supply brands you buy from are ethical and sustainable. Remember, every purchase we make has an impact, and by choosing ethical brands, we can make a difference in the world.
