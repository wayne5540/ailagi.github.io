# Smart Home Security Systems: Professional Monitoring vs. Self-monitoring 

Are you considering purchasing a smart home security system? With so many options available, it can be challenging to choose between professional monitoring and self-monitoring. In this post, we&#39;ll take a closer look at each type of monitoring to help you decide which one is right for you. 

## Professional Monitoring 

Professional monitoring is when a security company monitors your home 24/7 and responds to any security alarms. When a sensor is triggered, such as a door or window opening, the security company is immediately notified and can take appropriate action. Some of the benefits of professional monitoring include: 

- Immediate response to emergencies
- Monitoring of alarms even when you&#39;re not home
- Notification of local authorities in case of an emergency

However, professional monitoring can be expensive. Most companies require a monthly fee for their monitoring services. This fee can range from $20 to $60 per month depending on the company and the services provided.

## Self-Monitoring 

Self-monitoring is when you monitor your home security system yourself. With self-monitoring, you&#39;ll receive notifications on your smartphone or other mobile devices when a sensor is triggered. You&#39;ll be responsible for responding to the notification and contacting local authorities if necessary. Some of the benefits of self-monitoring include: 

- Lower cost than professional monitoring
- Ability to monitor your home security system yourself
- Flexibility to adjust monitoring based on your needs

However, self-monitoring can be less reliable than professional monitoring. If you don&#39;t respond to the notification or miss it, you could miss an emergency. Additionally, not all security systems offer self-monitoring as an option.

## Which Type of Monitoring Should You Choose? 

Ultimately, the type of monitoring you choose will depend on your personal preferences and needs. If you want immediate response to emergencies or aren&#39;t comfortable monitoring your security system yourself, professional monitoring may be the better choice. However, if you want to save money and have more flexibility in monitoring your security system, self-monitoring could be the way to go. 

No matter which type of monitoring you choose, having a smart home security system can provide peace of mind and additional security for your home. Consider your options carefully before making a decision.
