# Exploring Different Cooking Techniques: Raw, Baking, and Fermentation

Cooking is a fundamental aspect of our lives. It’s a means of nourishing our bodies while also indulging in delicious flavors and tastes.

One of the fantastic things about vegan and plant-based cooking is the variety of techniques and methods available. Three of the techniques that are commonly used in vegan and plant-based cooking are raw, baking, and fermentation.

## Raw Cooking
Raw cooking involves using fresh, raw fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds to create a variety of dishes. Raw cooking allows the natural flavors of the ingredients to shine through, and it is believed that raw cooking can help to retain more nutrients than cooked food. Some of the dishes that can be prepared using raw cooking techniques include salads, smoothie bowls, and raw desserts like cheesecakes, brownies, and pies.

## Baking
Baking is a popular technique used in vegan and plant-based cooking to create a wide range of sweet and savory dishes. Vegans use plant-based ingredients like nut milk, coconut oil, banana, and avocado to replace traditional baking ingredients like eggs, butter, and milk. Some vegan baking dishes may include fresh-baked bread, cakes, muffins, and pies, just to name a few.

## Fermentation
Fermentation is a fascinating cooking technique that utilizes microorganisms like bacteria and yeast to transform food. In vegan and plant-based cooking, fermentation is often used to create gut-healthy foods like miso, yogurt, kimchi, and sauerkraut. Fermentation is said to be a fantastic technique for creating delicious flavors, but it is also believed to have many health benefits, including promoting gut health and aiding digestion.
