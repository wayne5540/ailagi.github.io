## Natural Skincare 101: An Essential Shopping Guide

If you’re interested in an all-natural skincare routine, you’re in the right place! With a multitude of natural skincare products available in the market, it’s easier than ever to get started on your journey towards glowing, healthy skin. 

But where do you start? Here’s a shopping guide for natural skincare products:

### 1. Identify your skin type

First and foremost, it’s important to identify your skin type. This will help you choose the right products designed specifically for your skin’s unique needs. Some common skin types include oily, dry, combination and sensitive skin. 

### 2. Look for natural ingredients

When it comes to natural skincare, ingredients are key. Look for products made with organic, cruelty-free and natural ingredients such as aloe vera, chamomile, lavender, tea tree oil, and vitamin E. Avoid products with harsh chemicals and synthetic fragrances that can cause irritation and damage to skin. 

### 3. Consider the product’s purpose

Before buying a product, consider what purpose you want it to serve. Do you need a moisturizer? A facial cleanser? A face mask? A serum? Once you’ve identified the function of the product, you can narrow down your choices based on what you need. 

### 4. Brands matter

There are many natural skincare brands in the market, but not all are created equal. Look for brands with a reputation for producing high-quality, effective and all-natural skincare products. Some popular natural skincare brands include Biossance, Herbivore, and Blissoma among others. 

### 5. Price point

Natural skincare products tend to be on the pricier side compared to drugstore products. Keep in mind that investing in high-quality, all-natural skincare products is worth the extra cost. Also, don’t skimp on choosing the right products – your skin will thank you in the long run.

With these tips, you’re now equipped with the knowledge you need to shop for natural skincare products. Remember that what you put on your skin is just as important as what you put in your body, so choose wisely and enjoy the journey towards healthy, beautiful skin!
