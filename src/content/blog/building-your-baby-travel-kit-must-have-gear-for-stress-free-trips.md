# Building Your Baby Travel Kit: Must-Have Gear for Stress-free Trips

Are you planning a trip with your baby but are struggling with what gear to pack? Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ve got you covered. In this article, we&#39;ll show you the must-have gear for stress-free trips with your baby.

## Portable High Chair

A portable high chair is an essential item for any baby travel kit. It allows your little one to sit comfortably and safely during meal times. We recommend the [Inglesina Fast Table Chair](https://www.amazon.com/Inglesina-Table-Pay-Bib-Cream/dp/B00IOGIM9S/ref=sr_1_3). It&#39;s easy to install and fits most tables, making it a perfect option for eating out or at your Airbnb rental.

## Baby Carrier

A baby carrier is a lifesaver when traveling with a baby. It allows you to keep your baby close while navigating through busy airports or sightseeing at your destination. We recommend the [Ergobaby Omni 360](https://www.amazon.com/Ergobaby-Omni-All-Position-Carrying/dp/B077H19N1V/ref=sr_1_4). It&#39;s comfortable for both you and your baby and can be worn in multiple positions.

## Diaper Changing Pad

Changing your baby&#39;s diaper on-the-go can be challenging, but a portable diaper changing pad makes it much easier. We recommend the [Skip Hop Pronto Changing Station](https://www.amazon.com/Skip-Hop-Pronto-Changing-Station/dp/B01AFQI6RG/ref=sr_1_2). It&#39;s compact, has a built-in pillow, and can hold up to four diapers and wipes.

## Stroller

If you&#39;re planning on doing a lot of walking, a lightweight stroller can be a game-changer. We recommend the [Summer Infant 3D Lite](https://www.amazon.com/Summer-Infant-Convenience-Stroller-Black/dp/B00O20OCVC/ref=sr_1_1). It weighs only 13 pounds, has a compact fold, and a large storage basket.

## Baby Sunhat

Protecting your baby from the sun is crucial, and a good sunhat can help. We recommend the [i play. by green sprouts Snap Reusable Swim Diaper](https://www.amazon.com/play-Green-Sprouts-Reversible-Adjustable/dp/B08P8TXCQF/ref=sr_1_6). It&#39;s made from UPF 50+ material and has an adjustable head strap.

## Baby Travel Bag

You&#39;ll need a good bag to store all of your baby&#39;s gear. We recommend the [HaloVa Diaper Bag](https://www.amazon.com/HaloVa-Multi-Functional-Waterproof-Travel-Backpack/dp/B07F2B6KFT/ref=sr_1_5). It&#39;s waterproof, has multiple compartments, and comes with stroller straps for easy transportation.

With these must-have items in your baby travel kit, you&#39;ll be prepared for stress-free trips with your little one. Happy travels!
