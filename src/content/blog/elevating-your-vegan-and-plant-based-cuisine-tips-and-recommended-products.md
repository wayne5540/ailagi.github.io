Are you a vegan or plant-based eater who is looking to elevate your cooking game? Or are you new to the lifestyle and seeking guidance for where to start? Look no further than this guide for tips and recommended products.

**Tips:**

1. Experiment with different spices and herbs: Vegan and plant-based cuisine can be just as flavorful (if not more so) than traditional meat-based dishes. Don&#39;t be afraid to spice things up with a variety of herbs and spices, like cumin, coriander, turmeric, garlic, ginger, and smoked paprika.

2. Incorporate protein-rich foods: While many people worry about getting enough protein on a vegan or plant-based diet, there are plenty of protein-rich foods out there. Experiment with tofu, tempeh, seitan, beans, lentils, and quinoa.

3. Use alternative milks: If you&#39;re making a recipe that calls for milk, there are plenty of plant-based alternatives to choose from. Try almond milk, oat milk, coconut milk, or soy milk.

**Recommended Products:**

1. Nutritional yeast: This cheesy-tasting sprinkle is a go-to for many vegans and plant-based eaters. It&#39;s a great source of B vitamins and gives a cheesy flavor to dishes like mac and cheese or popcorn.

2. Liquid smoke: Want a smoky flavor without using bacon or other meat products? Try liquid smoke, which is made from burning wood and capturing the smoke in a liquid form. It&#39;s great for adding to chili, barbecue sauce, or even mashed potatoes.

3. Vegan cheese: While not all vegan cheeses are created equal, there are plenty of delicious options out there. Try brands like Miyoko&#39;s Creamery or Violife for melty, flavorful, and dairy-free cheese.

Incorporating these tips and products into your vegan or plant-based cooking routine can help take your dishes to the next level. Happy cooking!
