Are you a budget-conscious gardener who doesn&#39;t want to compromise on quality and sustainability? Look no further, we&#39;ve got you covered! This guide covers the top deals on organic gardening supplies that are both cost-effective and eco-friendly. 

First off, let&#39;s talk about soil. Healthy and fertile soil is the foundation of any successful garden, and organic gardening is no exception. We recommend opting for organic soil amendments like compost, peat moss, and vermiculite that are rich in nutrients and beneficial microorganisms. A 40-pound bag of organic compost typically costs around $10 whereas a 2.2-pound bag of organic vermiculite may cost around $7. These might seem like small bags but it goes a long way and believe us, your plants will thank you! 

Next up, organic fertilizers! Chemical fertilizers may provide a quick boost but often lead to soil depletion and can harm beneficial microbes and insects. Organic fertilizers like bone meal, blood meal, and fish emulsion are a healthier alternative that slowly release nutrients over time and build soil health. A 6-pound bag of organic bone meal costs around $13 (which can last you up to a year) whereas 16-ounce of blood meal costs around $7. 

Lastly, let&#39;s talk about pest control. Chemical pesticides may eliminate harmful pests but they also harm beneficial insects and are harmful to human and animal health. Opting for organic pest control like neem oil, diatomaceous earth, and companion planting are effective and safer alternatives. A 16-ounce bottle of organic neem oil costs around $16 whereas 5 pounds of diatomaceous earth may cost around $17. 

In conclusion, organic gardening doesn&#39;t have to be expensive. With some smart shopping and research, you can get the best deals on organic gardening supplies that are both sustainable and cost-effective. Happy gardening!
