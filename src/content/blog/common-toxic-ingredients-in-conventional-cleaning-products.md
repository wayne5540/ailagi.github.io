# Common Toxic Ingredients in Conventional Cleaning Products

When it comes to keeping our homes clean, we often rely on conventional cleaning products to do the job. However, many of these products contain harmful ingredients that can be toxic to both humans and the environment. In this post, we&#39;ll explore some of the most common toxic ingredients found in conventional cleaning products, and why switching to natural alternatives is a safer option.

## Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)

SLS is a surfactant that is commonly found in cleaning products such as dish soap, laundry detergent, and hand soap. While it may be effective at removing dirt and grime, it can also strip the skin of its natural oils and cause irritation, especially for those with sensitive skin.

## Phthalates

Phthalates are a type of plasticizer that are often added to cleaning products to improve their fragrance and texture. However, exposure to phthalates has been linked to a number of health issues, including reproductive problems and developmental disorders.

## Chlorine

Chlorine is another commonly used ingredient in cleaning products, particularly in bleach and toilet bowl cleaners. While it may be effective at killing germs and removing stains, it can also be harmful if ingested or inhaled, and can cause skin and eye irritation.

## Formaldehyde

Formaldehyde is a preservative that is often found in cleaning products, and has been linked to a number of health concerns, including cancer. While formaldehyde occurs naturally in some foods, exposure to high concentrations can be harmful.

## Ammonia

Ammonia is a powerful cleaning agent that is commonly found in glass cleaners and floor cleaners. However, it can be harmful if ingested or inhaled, and can cause eye and lung irritation. Those with asthma or other respiratory problems should avoid using products that contain ammonia.

Switching to natural cleaning products that contain ingredients such as vinegar, baking soda, and essential oils can be a safer and more eco-friendly alternative. Not only do these products avoid the use of harmful chemicals, but they also tend to be more affordable in the long run. So next time you&#39;re stocking up on cleaning supplies, consider making the switch to natural alternatives for a safer and healthier home.
