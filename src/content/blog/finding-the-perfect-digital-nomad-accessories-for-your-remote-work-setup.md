# Finding the Perfect Digital Nomad Accessories for Your Remote Work Setup

Are you a digital nomad searching for the best accessories to elevate your remote work setup? Look no further! We’ve got you covered. In this post, we’ll share our top picks for digital nomad accessories that will help you stay productive, comfortable, and stylish while working remotely.

## Portable Monitor

A portable monitor is a must for any remote worker who needs a larger screen than a laptop. With a portable monitor, you can easily set up a dual-screen display, work on multiple projects at the same time, or attend Zoom meetings with colleagues seamlessly. We recommend the Lepow 15.6-inch Portable Monitor for its lightweight and slim design, Full HD resolution, easy connectivity to laptops or tablets, and built-in speakers.

## Ergonomic Keyboard and Mouse

Typing for hours on a flat keyboard can cause wrist pain, muscle strain, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Avoid these health issues by investing in an ergonomic keyboard and mouse. These accessories are designed to reduce the risk of injury by keeping your hands, arms, and wrists in their natural positions while typing and clicking. Our top picks are the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard and Mouse Combo, which has a split keyboard and an angled mouse; and the Logitech MX Ergo Wireless Trackball Mouse, which allows you to customize the angle and height of the mouse for maximum comfort.

## Noise-Canceling Headphones

Working remotely sometimes means working from noisy cafes, airports, or co-living spaces. Stay focused and concentration with noise-canceling headphones that block out external sounds and help you immerse yourself in your work. Our top picks are the Bose QuietComfort 35 II wireless headphones with Alexa voice control, and the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones with advanced noise canceling features, hands-free calls, and up to 30 hours of battery life.

## Travel-Friendly Backpack

As a digital nomad, you need a reliable backpack that can carry all your work essentials and fit in the overhead compartment of a plane or train. Look for a backpack with multiple compartments, padded sleeves for laptops and tablets, and ergonomic straps for comfortable carrying. Our top picks are the eBags Professional Slim Laptop Backpack, which has a smart organization system, a TSA-friendly laptop compartment, and a USB port for charging devices on the go; and the Tortuga Setout Backpack, which has a spacious main compartment, a sleek design, and a hideaway shoulder straps and hip belt for easy stowing in tight spaces.

## Standing Desk Converter

Sitting for prolonged periods can lead to back pain, poor posture, and fatigue. Give your body a break by using a standing desk converter that allows you to alternate between sitting and standing while working. Our top pick is the VariDesk ProPlus 36, which can hold up to two monitors, raises and lowers within seconds by using a spring-assisted lift, and features a spacious keyboard tray and a phone/tablet slot.

## Conclusion

These are our top picks for digital nomad accessories that can help you optimize your remote work setup for productivity, comfort, and style. Of course, your needs and preferences may vary based on your job, budget, and lifestyle. However, we believe that investing in high-quality accessories is worth it if you want to enjoy remote work to the fullest. So go ahead and upgrade your digital nomad toolkit today!
