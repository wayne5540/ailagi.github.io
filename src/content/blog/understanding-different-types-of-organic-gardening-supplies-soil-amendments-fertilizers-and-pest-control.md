# Understanding Different Types of Organic Gardening Supplies

## Soil Amendments

Soil amendments are materials added to the soil to improve soil quality. These can include:

- Compost
- Manure
- Peat moss
- Perlite
- Vermiculite
- Limestone
- Gypsum

Compost and manure are excellent soil amendments as they provide nutrients to the soil and improve soil structure. Peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite improve soil drainage and aeration, while limestone and gypsum are used to adjust soil pH.

## Fertilizers

Fertilizers are materials added to the soil to provide plants with essential nutrients. There are three main types of fertilizers:

- Organic
- Inorganic
- Synthetic

Organic fertilizers come from natural sources like plants and animals, while inorganic fertilizers are chemically synthesized. Synthetic fertilizers are made from chemicals designed to mimic the nutrients found in organic and inorganic fertilizers.

Organic fertilizers are favored by many organic gardeners as they are slow-release and provide a steady supply of nutrients to plants. Inorganic and synthetic fertilizers are faster acting but can result in nutrient imbalances in the soil if overused.

## Pest Control

Keeping pests under control in an organic garden can be a challenge. However, there are several organic methods that can be used, such as:

- Companion planting
- Beneficial insects
- Homemade remedies
- Neem oil
- Diatomaceous earth

Companion planting involves planting certain plants together that have natural pest-repelling qualities. Beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings can also be introduced to the garden to help control pests. Homemade remedies like garlic spray and soap sprays can be effective in controlling pests, and neem oil and diatomaceous earth can be used to control a variety of pests.

By understanding the different types of organic gardening supplies available, you can choose the materials that best suit your needs and create a healthy, thriving organic garden.
