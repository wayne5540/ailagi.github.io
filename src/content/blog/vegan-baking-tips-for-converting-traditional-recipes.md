# Vegan Baking: Tips for Converting Traditional Recipes

Are you trying to accommodate your vegan lifestyle and still enjoy delicious pastries, cakes, and muffins? Converting traditional recipes to vegan-friendly options may be the answer. Here are some tips to help you make your favourite baked goods in a vegan version.

## Start with Simple Recipes

If you are new to vegan baking, start with simple recipes. This will help you to learn the basic techniques of replacing dairy and eggs to suit your vegan diet. As you become more confident, you can experiment with more complex recipes.

## Replace Dairy Products

In traditional baking recipes, dairy products such as butter, milk, and cream are common ingredients. In vegan baking, there are plenty of substitutes available. Some of the most commonly used dairy substitutes include almond milk, soy milk, and coconut milk. You can also use vegan butter or margarine instead of traditional butter. 

## Replace Eggs

Eggs are a common ingredient used in traditional baking since they provide moisture, structure and act as a binding agent. However, there are many vegan substitutes for eggs that work well when baking. Some popular options include flax eggs, applesauce, mashed bananas and aquafaba. 

## Ensure Proper Proportions

One of the biggest challenges in vegan baking is achieving the right texture in your finished product. This usually requires some adjustments in the quantities of ingredients used. Take the time to learn how the different substitutes work and how to use them in the proper proportions. This will ensure that your vegan baked goods come out just right. 

## Use High Quality Vegan Baking Supplies

Using high-quality vegan products is essential for achieving the best results in baking. Vegan baking supplies such as egg replacers, vegan butters, and plant-based milk alternatives are available in most grocery stores. You can also find them in specialty stores and online shops. 

With these tips, you are well on your way to creating delicious vegan baked goods. Remember, the key to success is practice and experimentation. So, grab your vegan baking supplies and start baking today!
