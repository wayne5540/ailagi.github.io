# How to Build a Natural Hair Care Routine for Your Hair Goals

If you have natural hair, you know how important it is to maintain a healthy hair care routine. But with so many products on the market, it can be overwhelming to figure out what works best for your hair type and hair goals. In this blog post, we will provide you with tips and product recommendations on how to build a natural hair care routine to achieve your hair goals.

## Step 1: Determine Your Hair Goals

Before you can start building a hair care routine, you need to determine what your hair goals are. Are you trying to improve hair growth, retain length, add moisture, reduce breakage, or all of the above? Once you have identified your hair goals, you can select the right products to incorporate into your routine.

## Step 2: Choose the Right Shampoo and Conditioner

The foundation of any natural hair care routine is a good shampoo and conditioner. Look for products that are specifically designed for your hair type and hair goals. For example, if you have dry hair, look for a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner that will help restore moisture to your hair. If you have a sensitive scalp, look for products that are free from sulfates and other harsh ingredients.

## Step 3: Incorporate Deep Conditioning Treatments

Deep conditioning is important for maintaining healthy natural hair. Look for hair masks and treatments that contain natural ingredients such as honey, avocado, and coconut oil. These ingredients will help nourish and repair your hair from the inside out.

## Step 4: Moisturize and Seal

Moisturizing and sealing is an essential step in any natural hair care routine. Look for products that contain natural oils like jojoba oil, castor oil, and shea butter. These ingredients will help seal moisture into your hair and prevent breakage.

## Step 5: Protect Your Hair at Night

Protecting your hair at night is an important step in any hair care routine. Use a silk or satin pillowcase to prevent breakage and protect your hair from friction. You can also try wearing a silk or satin bonnet to keep your hair protected while you sleep.
