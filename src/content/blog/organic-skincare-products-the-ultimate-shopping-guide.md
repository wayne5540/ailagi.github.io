If you’re looking to upgrade your skincare routine with natural and organic products, you’ve come to the right place. In this ultimate shopping guide, we’ll give you the lowdown on everything you need to know about organic skincare, and help you find the best products to suit your needs.

First off, what exactly is organic skincare? Essentially, it’s skincare made with natural ingredients that haven’t been exposed to synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. These products are typically better for both your skin and the environment, as they’re free from harsh chemicals that can be harmful and irritating.

When shopping for organic skincare products, it’s important to look for a few key things. First, make sure the product is certified organic – this means it’s been independently verified to meet certain standards for safety and sustainability. It’s also a good idea to read the ingredient list carefully, as some products may contain hidden chemicals or fragrances that are not organic or natural. Look for products that contain natural plant-based ingredients, like aloe vera, chamomile, and jojoba oil, which are known for their hydrating and nourishing properties.

So, what are some of the best organic skincare products on the market? Here are a few of our top picks:

- **Herbivore Botanicals Blue Tansy Resurfacing Clarity Mask**: This mask is made with blue tansy oil, which is known for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. It works to gently exfoliate and resurface the skin, leaving it smooth and glowing.

- **Drunk Elephant Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil**: This oil is rich in antioxidants and essential fatty acids, which help to nourish and hydrate the skin. It’s great for all skin types, and can be used alone or mixed with your favorite moisturizer.

- **Indie Lee Brightening Cleanser**: This cleanser is packed with natural ingredients like strawberry seed oil and tomato extract, which work together to remove impurities and brighten the skin. It’s gentle enough for daily use, and leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed.

- **Herbivore Botanicals Pink Cloud Rosewater Moisture Cream**: This lightweight moisturizer is made with natural ingredients like rosewater, aloe vera, and white tea extract, which work together to hydrate and soothe the skin.
